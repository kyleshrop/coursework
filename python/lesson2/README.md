Recreated the API that was previously created on js for python and implemented 

Created a POST request that finds the users IP and converts the provided string into uppercase

Methods used:

    str() = convert to string
    request.args.to_dict() = converts the orginal immutable dictionary into one that is usable
    .upper()= convert the attatched string to capitals
